# Some stuff that is a bit more google-ish... some keystrokes, trash setup, etc
#
# Tried to work with google but "improve" IMO.  Example I prefer a
# for archive rather than e.  I also have some other quick marcos for GTD
# folders.
#
# Also, I think archiving when delete is broken... I prefer archiving when I
# want other wise delete when I say delete.  If you want google's behaviour you
# should use google-strict instead of this one.
