muttrc is linked to $HOME/.muttrc

By default when I run mutt it loads muttrc which loads some common settings,
then local system settings (eg. OS specific), then loads the default account.
That sets stuff like the mailboxes, spooldir for the provider, etc.

provider/ contains all settings specific to a mail provider (spool dir, bindings, etc)
platform/ has os specific settings
accounts/ has all account specific settings
private/ contains files that are included for mail passwords etc.

NOTE:

I use msmtp for sending mail.  You could also use mutt compliled with smtp
support.

TODO:

common will be split out into separate files when I have time to refactor.

smime is not finished yet but does work for signature verification.

GPG is setup using defaults
